# Airline Data Analysis and Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing airline data to uncover patterns and build predictive models for flight operations. The dataset includes flight records from 12 unique airlines, and the analysis aims to derive actionable insights for optimizing airline schedules, pricing strategies, and customer satisfaction.

## Objective
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends in flight operations, such as preferred airlines, popular routes, and common departure/arrival locations.
- Utilize **Machine Learning models** to predict flight prices and analyze the factors influencing customer preferences.
- Deliver **actionable insights** for improving operational efficiency, pricing strategies, and enhancing the customer experience.

## Dataset
The dataset contains **10,683 flight records** with the following features:
- Airline Name
- Date of Journey
- Source and Destination Locations
- Flight Duration
- Total Stops
- Departure and Arrival Times
- Additional Information

## Key Insights
- **Most Frequent Airline:** Jet Airways (3,849 occurrences).
- **Most Common Route:** DEL → BOM → COK (2,376 occurrences).
- **Popular Source Location:** Delhi (4,537 occurrences).
- **Popular Destination Location:** Cochin (4,537 occurrences).
- **Majority of Flights:** Take off from Delhi and land in Cochin.

## Techniques and Methodology

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed trends in airline popularity, flight duration, stops, and timings.
- Investigated patterns in departure and arrival times to determine peak flight hours.
- Explored the relationship between various features (e.g., source, destination, airline, and flight duration).

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
- Extracted meaningful features such as flight duration, departure/arrival timings, and the number of stops.
- Handled missing values and applied necessary transformations to prepare data for modeling.

### 3. **Data Modeling**
- Built **predictive models** to forecast flight prices based on factors like airline, route, stops, and timings.
- Applied **classification models** to predict customer preferences for certain airlines or routes based on historical data.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and precision metrics.

## Key Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python:** For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** For interactive data analysis and visualization.
